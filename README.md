* different format for dates/times/datetimes
* include relation fields in show and index templates
* shorter form names
* real entity names instead of "$entity" in actions and templates
* translated texts
* support for form themes (customizable)
* default templates suitable with Boostrap and Font Awesome
* nice "check" icons for boolean fields (when using Font Awesome)
* support for pagination (requires [KnpPaginatorBundle](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpPaginatorBundle))
* support for filters (requires [LexikFormFilterBundle](https://github.com/lexik/LexikFormFilterBundle))
* support for sorting
* better generated tests
* fixtures generation
